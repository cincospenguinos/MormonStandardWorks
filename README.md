# MormonStandardWorks

A visualization exploring the similarity of the LDS standard works (particularly the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price) to a variety of works from the 19th century and earlier.

## Organization

There are two components to this repository: the website and the analysis. The website (under the directory `visualization`) is what GitHub will use. The other directory `analysis` is what is used to generate the data for the website.
